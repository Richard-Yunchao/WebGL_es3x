# WebGL_es3x

Intension:
This project is used to expose OpenGL ES 3.x features to web via WebGL
extensions. It includes a webgl extension to expose multisample texture.
More extensions might be included to expose OpenGL ES 3.1 core features
(except multisample texture) and geometry shader, and some other features
in OpenGL 3.1 or 3.2.

How to use this project:
Download the project into your local machine. Copy it to ./extensions/proposals/
in KhronosGroup/WebGL.git project.
Run 'make' at ./extensions filefolder. You will get .html file under different
extensions filefolder, say ./extensions/proposals/WEBGL_multisample_texture/.
Then open that .html file with Chrome browser, check it.

Contributions are welcome.
